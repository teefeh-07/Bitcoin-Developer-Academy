Title: Built Bitcoin Developer Academy - Learn Bitcoin Development Through Interactive Tutorials

I've been working on solving a problem I've personally experienced: the lack of quality Bitcoin development education.

Most blockchain education focuses on Ethereum, and existing Bitcoin resources are either too basic or assume you're already an expert. So I built Bitcoin Developer Academy - the first comprehensive education platform specifically for Bitcoin development.

Key features:
• Interactive tutorials where you write real Clarity smart contracts
• Verifiable NFT certificates stored on Bitcoin's Layer 2 (Stacks)
• Progressive learning from beginner to advanced concepts
• Community-driven curriculum that evolves with the ecosystem

The platform is built on Stacks, which allows us to create sophisticated educational tools while staying true to Bitcoin's principles. Students learn by building real applications, not just reading theory.

Currently live with the "Hello Clarity" tutorial - perfect for developers new to Bitcoin development. Planning to add more advanced courses covering DeFi, NFTs, and Bitcoin integration.

This is part of my Stacks Ascent journey, and I'm committed to making Bitcoin development education accessible to everyone.

Would love feedback from the Bitcoin community! What topics would you most want to see covered in Bitcoin development education?
