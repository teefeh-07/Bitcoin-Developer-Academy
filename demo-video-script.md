# Bitcoin Developer Academy - Demo Video Script

**Duration: 3-4 minutes**
**Target: Stacks Ascent Level 2 Submission**

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Bitcoin Developer Academy Homepage]**

**Narrator:** "Hi everyone! I'm excited to show you Bitcoin Developer Academy - the first decentralized education platform built specifically for Bitcoin developers on Stacks."

**[Highlight key features on homepage]**

"This platform solves a real problem: there's a massive gap in quality Bitcoin development education. Most resources are either too basic or assume you're already an expert."

---

## Problem & Solution (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Screen: Show traditional coding education vs Bitcoin Developer Academy]**

**Narrator:** "Traditional coding bootcamps don't teach Bitcoin development, and existing blockchain education focuses on Ethereum. Bitcoin developers need Bitcoin-native education."

**[Screen: Show the three key differentiators]**

"Bitcoin Developer Academy offers three unique advantages:
1. **Learn by Doing** - Write real smart contracts, not just theory
2. **Verifiable Credentials** - NFT certificates stored on Bitcoin's Layer 2
3. **Community-Driven** - Curriculum that evolves with the ecosystem"

---

## Live Demo: Tutorial Experience (1:00 - 2:30)

**[Screen: Navigate to Tutorials page]**

**Narrator:** "Let me show you how it works. Here's our course catalog with difficulty levels and time estimates."

**[Click on "Hello Clarity" tutorial]**

"I'll start with 'Hello Clarity' - our beginner-friendly introduction to smart contracts."

**[Screen: Tutorial interface loads]**

"Notice the clean, step-by-step interface. On the left, we have the tutorial content with explanations and examples. On the right, there's a fully-featured code editor with Clarity syntax highlighting."

**[Type in the code editor]**

"Let me write my first Clarity function:"

```clarity
(define-public (hello-world)
  (ok "Hello, Bitcoin!"))
```

**[Click "Run Code" button]**

"I can test my code directly in the browser. The editor provides real-time feedback and syntax highlighting specifically designed for Clarity."

**[Show the step progression]**

"As I complete each step, my progress is tracked. The tutorial guides me through increasingly complex concepts, from basic functions to data variables and more."

## Smart Contract Integration (2:30 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Show wallet connection]**

**Narrator:** "Now here's where it gets exciting. I can connect my Stacks wallet to interact with real smart contracts."

**[Connect wallet - show the connection process]**

"Once connected, completing tutorials triggers actual smart contract calls. When I finish a course, I earn a verifiable NFT certificate."

**[Screen: Show certificate minting process]**

"This certificate is minted on-chain and proves my completion of the course. Employers can verify it's authentic by checking the blockchain."

---

## Dashboard & Progress (3:00 - 3:30)

**[Screen: Navigate to Dashboard]**

**Narrator:** "The dashboard shows my learning progress, earned certificates, and achievement statistics."

**[Highlight key metrics]**

"I can see my completed modules, total points, learning streak, and skill level progression. The certificates are beautifully displayed and shareable."

**[Show certificate details]**

"Each certificate includes course details, completion date, skill level, and blockchain verification. This creates a permanent, tamper-proof record of my Bitcoin development skills."

---

## Technical Architecture (3:30 - 3:50)

**[Screen: Show code/architecture briefly]**

**Narrator:** "Under the hood, this runs on two Clarity smart contracts deployed to Stacks testnet - one for certificate NFTs and another for progress tracking. The frontend is built with Next.js and integrates seamlessly with Stacks wallets."

**[Show the deployed contracts]**

"Everything is open source and built with modern web technologies, making it accessible to developers worldwide."

---

## Closing & Call to Action (3:50 - 4:00)

**[Screen: Back to homepage with clear CTAs]**

**Narrator:** "Bitcoin Developer Academy is live and ready for the community. Whether you're new to Bitcoin development or want to expand your skills, start your journey today."

**[Show social links and community]**

"Join our growing community of Bitcoin builders. The future of Bitcoin development education is here, and it's built on Bitcoin itself."

**[End screen with key links]**
